Compute stage 1
	- Calculate density
	- Calculate pressure

Compute stage 2
	- Calculate forces
		- Pressure
		- Viscosity
		- External (gravity)
		- Total = Pressure + Viscosity + External

Compute stage 3
	- Leapfrog integration
		- acceleration_i = total force / density_i
		- velocity_i = velocity_i + time_step * acceleration_i  
		- position_i = position_i + time_step * velocity_i
